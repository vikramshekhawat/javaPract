    The missions are numbered from 0 to N-1. The K-th mission has an integer D[K] assigned, representing its difficulty level.
    During a day, you can perform any number of missions given the two following rules:
            • missions should be performed in the specified order, in other words, a mission can be undertaken only if all of the missions preceding it have already been completed;
• the difference between the difficulty levels of any two missions performed on the same day should not be greater than an integer X.
